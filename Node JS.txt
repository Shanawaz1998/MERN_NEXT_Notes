Express js is mainly used for routing

www.google.com -> Base URL
www.google.com/search -> /search is the route

-->Middleware;

If we want to run some code before running the actual route, then we can use Middleware
Syntax :-
app.use((req, resp, next)={next()})
Here next() calling is imp because it is used to call the PerformanceResourceTiming, if we dont use next(), then the route will not be called

-->Dynamic Routing

To make any route dynamic we need to use :"any variable" and to access that variable we need to take is from the req.params.variableName

-->Template Engine

EJS - EJS is html with superpower, it is used to render html inside server (e.g., pug, ejs, jade, handlebars)
EJS is very similar to HTML 
PUG and jade is very similar to python

Steps
1) install ejs - npm i ejs

2) configure ejs - app.set("view engine","ejs")

3) Make one folder with the name - views

4) make one file with .ejs extension

5) As till now we were using send() in the get funct just replace that send to render and only the filename inside the arg of render() funct. 

Note: TO send the data from the server file to the view(HTML), then we can send it as :- app.send("index", {name: "Shanawaz"})
To access the name in the html page :- <%= name %>

--> Express Static files setup

We have to create a folder 
To setup static files we have to use -> app.use(express.static('./public))

--> Express Generator

It is used to make the express project(Folder), which reduces the process to do it manually

Steps 
1) Need to install express-Generator globally in the system by using the command :- npm i express-generator -g
2) Create new app by using the command :- express appName --view=ejs
